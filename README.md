## Next Steps
-	Collect and annotate additional aerial images featuring open grounds, and incorporate some images from the DOTA dataset.
-	Train and evaluate various object detection models (EfficientDet, RetinaNet, and SSD), including currently used, on aerial images that include all three classes: parks, open grounds, and specialized sports facilities.
-	Compile the results in a table and provide an interpretation of the findings.
